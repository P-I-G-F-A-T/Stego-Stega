1) This code can be optimized with numpy.
By using numpy and a slightly different algorithm, this can be made to work with png and jpeg images.
(It could work with any image file so long as numpy can read/write the matrix representations.)
Since Numpy's matrix operations are optimized for speed this will also make the process much faster.

2) The sequence of file creations can be improved.
It's messy, consumes space, and has an awkward naming.

3) If the text encoding (ASCII, Unicode, etc) is specified, then it could be written to work different texts.

4) As far as stego goes, this is easy to crack.
There are many steganalysis algorithms out there that can easily defeat this.
So this algorithm might work in some cases, but the method of concealment has huge room for improvement.

5) The program does not encrypt the message at all.
A user can encrypt the message before hand by using other programs, but there's no built-in specification.
This goes outside of stego, so not sure if it should be added or not.

6) Most importantly: The documentation in the code is pretty sloppy and can possibly be streamlined into smaller files.
