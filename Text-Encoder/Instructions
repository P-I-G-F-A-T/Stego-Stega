# Text-Encoder (Alpha) Instructions

Text-Encoder works like this:
It all depends on Python's PIL

Using EvenOut.py it takes in an RGBA png and changes each pixel dimension to an even number (subtracts the parity).
This will create a new image file so that the original is unchanged.

Then it uses BitIn.py (which depends on TextToBytes2.py):
It will ask for a string of a ascii-valued text.
It will also ask for the even'd out image.
It writes the message into the even'd out image by adding in the byte representation into the pixel dimensions.
(So if the message is larger than the image's width*height*4, then there will likely be an error.)
This will create a new image file as well.
==> This is the Stegangraphic Image

To decode the Steganographic Image, use GetBytes.py on the Stego'd Image.
This will go through and read each pixel's values as a string of bytes and create a .txt file.

Then use unStego.py to read the .txt file
This will print the hidden message.
